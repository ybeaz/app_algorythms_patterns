**Shortest Substring Containing Characters**

Given a string made up of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', determine the length of the shortest substring that includes at least one of each distinct letter present in the string.

### Example

_givenString = dabbcabcd_

The list of all characters in the string is _[a, b, c, d]_.

Two of the substrings that contain all letters are _dabbc_ and _abcd_.

The shortest substring that contains all of the letters is _4_ characters long. Return _4_ as the answer.

### Function Description

Complete the function **shortestSubstring** in the editor with the following parameter(s):

- **string givenString:** the string

### Returns

- **int:** the length of the shortest substring that contains at least one of each character in _givenString_

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ size of givenString ≤ 10^5
- each givenString[i] is in the set ascii[a-z]

### Input Format For Custom Testing

The first line contains a string, _givenString_.

### Sample Case 0

**Sample Input**

```
bab
```

**Sample Output**

```
2
```

**Explanation**

"ba" is a substring that contains all the characters in _givenString_.

### Sample Case 1

**Sample Input**

```
asdfkjeghfalawefhaef
```

**Sample Output**

```
13
```

**Explanation**

The 11 distinct characters in _givenString_ are [a, d, e, f, g, h, j, k, l, s, w]. The shortest substring with all of the characters is 13 characters long: _sdfkjeghfalaw_.
